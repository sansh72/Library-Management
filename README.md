## Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System implemented in C. It allows users to perform various operations like adding books to the library, displaying the library contents, taking books from the library, returning books to the library, and displaying the list of students who have issued books from the library.

### Features
- **Add a Book**: Users can add books to the library by providing the title, genre, and quantity of the books.
- **Display Library**: Users can view the contents of the library, including the title, genre, and number of items for each book.
- **Take a Book**: Students can take books from the library by specifying the index of the book they want to take and their enrolment number.
- **Return a Book**: Students can return books to the library by specifying the index of the book they want to return and their enrolment number.
- **Display Takers**: Users can view the list of students who have issued books from the library.

### Usage
1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc -o library main.c`).
2. Run the executable file (e.g., `./library`).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations.

### How to Use
1. Choose an option from the main menu by entering the corresponding number.
2. Follow the prompts to input necessary information (e.g., book details, enrolment number).
3. View the output messages to confirm the success or failure of the operation.

### Note
- Ensure proper formatting of input data (e.g., titles, enrolment numbers) to prevent unexpected behavior.
- The program may display error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
